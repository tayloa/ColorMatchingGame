      <p>The goal of the game is to guess the RGB values of the swatch on the left by using the sliders. The swatch on the right will show the color you have currently selected.</p?>
      <p>You'll have 15 seconds to submit an answer, or you'll get 0 points. Once you have an answer you're happy with, press the "Submit Answer" button.</p>
      <p>You may choose a difficulty, which will impact how your answer is scored, and how many rounds you would like to play.</p>
