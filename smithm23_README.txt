Homework 2

1. Using a jQuery plugin is easier then using JavaScript with jQuery. It also saves time when running the program. 

2. Our jQuery is able to access what is needed for the program. By using jQuery, we are able to access what is neccecary and let the unnessacary information be untouched. 

3. I am not sure if anything would prevent us from POSTing high hscores to the server. If we are able to then we would just need to use AJAX.

4. We would be able to store names and scores. We would not want to store privite information such as passwords, or personal information.
